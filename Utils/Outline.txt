1. Business Understanding (Stakeholders Input)
* Goal
* Hypothesis
* Analytical Questions
* information about the project if applicable
2. Data Understanding
* Load dataset
* Clean dataset
* EDA (info, describe, duplicates, appropriate columns)
* Univariate (Histogram, check for outliers, check density plots)
* Bivariate Analysis (pair plots, correlation heatmap, etc)
* Multivariate Analysis (PCA)
* Answer analytical questions
* Test Hypothesis
3. Data Preparation
* Check if dataset is balanced (Visualize)
* Split data into x and y & (train & eval)
* Encode y labels
* Create your transformers based on your understanding of the data so far (imputation, scaling)
4.Modelling & Evaluation  
* Choose models to train (distance, gradient descent, tree-based +)
* Train on unbalanced dataset (if applicable)
* Train on balanced data (if applicable)
* Hyperparameter Tuning
* Model Persistence
